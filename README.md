# Simple Music Player

## Overview

This is a simple web-based music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play, pause, and control an audio file directly in their browser. The player includes essential features such as:

- **Play/Pause button** to toggle audio playback
- **Progress bar** that shows the current time and total duration of the audio
- **Volume control** to adjust the audio's volume
- **Current time and duration display** to show how much time has passed and the total duration of the audio

### Features

- Play and pause audio with a single button
- Track audio progress with a dynamic progress bar
- Adjust volume with a slider
- Display current playback time and total duration
- Responsive and user-friendly design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need:
- A browser that supports HTML5 `<audio>` element (modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A local audio file (MP3 or any supported format) to play

### Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**

   - **Option 1**: Download the project as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.
   - **Option 2**: Clone the repository using Git:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-player.git
     ```

2. **Add an Audio File**

   - Replace the `src` attribute of the `<audio>` tag in `index.html` with the path to your own audio file:

     ```html
     <audio id="audio" src="your-audio-file.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>
     ```

   - You can test it with any `.mp3` file, for example: `sample-audio.mp3`.

3. **Open in Browser**

   - Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the music player.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure
- The `<audio>` element is used to load and play the audio file.
- The play/pause button (`<button id="playPauseBtn">`) allows the user to toggle the playback.
- A range input (`<input type="range" id="progress">`) is used to display and control the current time of the audio.
- Another range input (`<input type="range" id="volume">`) is used to control the audio volume.
- The current time (`<span id="currentTime">`) and duration (`<span id="duration">`) are displayed as text next to the progress bar.

### JavaScript Functionality
- **Play/Pause Toggle**: The `playPauseBtn` listens for a click event. When clicked, it either plays or pauses the audio, updating the button text accordingly.
- **Progress Bar**: As the audio plays, the `timeupdate` event updates the progress bar to reflect the current playback time. Users can also click or drag the progress bar to seek through the audio.
- **Volume Control**: The `input` event on the volume slider adjusts the volume of the audio by setting the `audio.volume` property.
- **Time Formatting**: The current time and total duration of the audio are formatted in a `minutes:seconds` format.

## Future Improvements

- **Playlist Support**: Allow users to create and manage a playlist.
- **Next/Previous Track**: Add buttons to skip to the next or previous audio track in a playlist.
- **Shuffle/Repeat Mode**: Implement shuffle and repeat functionality for better user experience.
- **Customizable UI**: Enhance the styling of the player to add visualizations, buttons with icons, or a full-screen mode.
- **Autoplay Feature**: Option to autoplay the next song in a playlist or automatically start the player when the page loads.
